        <div class="mb-5">
<!--         <p class="lead mb-3">Senior Research Assistant @ Oregon Health and Science University</p> -->
        <p>I graduated from the University of Denver in three years with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology in 2019. After college, I worked at a community mental health clinic and then transitioned to research. Most recently, I conducted a study on psychotropic medications in child welfare populations.</p>
        <p>I'm currently applying to medical school, and enjoying life with friends, family and my partner!</p>
<!--         <p>I'm currently applying to graduate school to get my PhD in clinical psychology, working, and enjoying life with friends!</p> -->
        <!-- <p>I first decided I wanted to pursue clinical psychology while taking an “Intro to Neurobiology” course at the University of Denver. This class introduced me to the multitude of complex mechanisms involved in brain functioning. While I found all the lectures fascinating, one lesson in particular stood out significantly: the biological hypotheses of schizophrenia. I was captivated by the complexity of the biological components that contribute to the clinical expression of schizophrenia. My curiosity regarding abnormal neurobiological functions and the influence it has on psychotic behavior ultimately led me to declare a concentration in cognitive neuroscience. Immersion in these specific courses revealed how additional multi-dimensional factors further affect the expression of schizophrenia. I approached Dr. Anne DePrince at the University of Denver and expressed my interest in her research regarding trauma exposure. In Dr. DePrince’s Traumatic Stress Studies lab, I had the opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of multidisciplinary responses in regard to child abuse. During my time as a research assistant, I began to understand the importance of specific symptom competency and corresponding targeted early interventions. Furthermore, through this experience, I gained insight around the process of publishing research and the impact research in a subject I care about has on advocacy and social change.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>In three years I earned a degree from DU, developed a passion for clinical psychology and an eagerness to continue contributing to the field. Confident in my educational groundwork, I applied to a competitive position working with a first episode psychosis early intervention team. A few weeks later, I was enthusiastically welcomed to the team. I have gained a tremendous amount of insight around the behaviors and clinical expression of psychosis from the work I do at AllHealthNetwork. My innate ability to empathize has helped me to build strong therapeutic relationships with my clients, and it is through these relationships that my comprehensive understanding of psychosis and its clinical expression has grown, especially in understanding how bio-psycho-social factors influence client’s development and expression of symptoms.</p> -->
